# Description 
This project aims to create a web-based graphical interface for managing virtual machines using React.js on the frontend and C on the backend.
The backend integrates with libvirt to handle QEMU virtual machine commands such as creating, listing, and managing instances.
# How to start the  project
# ------------------------------
React Setup

The project already includes package.json and package-lock.json files.
This means you don’t need to run npm init — the project configuration is already defined.

To install all required dependencies, simply run:
npm install -y
npm install react react-dom
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react --save-dev

Once installation is complete, start the development server with:
npm run dev  (Make sure  u are  in the  front directory)
